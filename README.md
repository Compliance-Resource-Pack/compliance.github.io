## What is this website?
This website was created to show off everything related to the Faithful Resource Pack for Minecraft. On it you'll find the main pack, add-ons, mod support and much more.

# Installation process:

There are two requirements before developing or previewing the website. First you need [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/). With Ruby you will need to install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by typing the following command in your favorite terminal:
```
gem install bundler jekyll
```
**If you are using Ruby 3 or higher, you also need to install Webrick:**
```
gem install webrick
```

Then you need to install the bundle provided in the [Gemfile](./Gemfile):
```
bundle install
```

After that, you need to build the website with this command:
```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

Now we have a hybrid website with dynamic content using Jekyll!

Install all dependencies:
```
npm install --save-dev
```

Create a file called `.env` in the root folder, following the formatting of the `.env.example` file

From there, run these commands in **separate terminal windows** to preview and automatically rebuild the website if an existing file changes:
```
npm run dev-watch-site

npm run dev-watch-app
```

After that you can enjoy your website on your local machine at http://localhost:8110, where the numbers at the end are the PORT number in the `.env` file created earlier. Enjoy!
