<h2>What is Faithful?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Faithful is a set of Minecraft resource packs that aim to re-create Minecraft's default textures in higher resolutions, while maintaining the overall look and feel. They're available in Regular and Classic flavours, each having a 32x and 64x version.

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Faithful was created by Vattic all the way back in 2010, and was the first texture pack of its kind. Over time, it gained other contributors and grew into a well-known project. <br>Faithful would continue being updated for the latest Minecraft version all the way until 2016, when Vattic unexpectedly went on a hiatus, which would go on to be over 4 years long. During this period of stagnation, development was picked up by a person known as xMrVizzy/Kraineff, who made textures for the 1.9 update, and eventually took over the pack as a whole. This by itself would have been fine, but he decided to claim that he'd gotten Vattic's permission to continue the pack (when he got none) as well as sell the pack on the Minecraft Bedrock Marketplace while continuing to use a magnitude of Vattic's textures, which goes against Vattic's original license.<br>If you want to know more about this part of the story, watch <a href="https://youtu.be/kgZYBTlwaVs">this video</a>.<br>Unfortunately, Kraineff got away with this for quite some time. Eventually, in November of 2020, the Compliance project split off from Kraineff's pack due to other disagreements with him, and EM (now Classic Faithful) soon followed in its wake.<br>When Kraineff's frauds were found out, the joint Compliance and EM forces decided to take over Faithful, rebranding themselves as Faithful and Classic Faithful, respectively. This marked a new era for the pack, one of open-source nature and availability to everyone.

<h2>What projects does Faithful offer?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Currently, Faithful is split into two main packs, each having a 32x and 64x version:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>(Regular) Faithful:</strong> Aims to re-create Minecraft's default textures while keeping the same look and feel, but takes some creative liberties to better make use of the extra resolution, such as by conveying the material more clearly.</li>
    <li><strong>Classic Faithful:</strong> A spiritual successor to Vattic's original Faithful, maintaining its classic art style and feel.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Along with these, several sub-projects exist as extras for Faithful:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Faithful Add-ons and Faithful Tweaks:</strong> Additional resource packs that require a base Faithful pack to work, and either change existing features of the game or add new ones using various methods. See the #faq channel in our <a href="https://discord.gg/sN9YRQbBv7">Discord server</a> to find out the exact definition and the difference between the two.</li>
  </ul>
