  The one and only, Faithful 32x boasts a modern, detailed art style that focuses on reimagining textures instead of simply redrawing them, taking full advantage of the higher resolution. Its notable features include a limited palette and a strive for consistency.

  The pack has evolved tremendously over the years. Ever since it was originally started by Vattic all the way back in 2010, it has become a cultural icon and has been enjoyed by millions of Minecraft players. Ready to become one of them?
