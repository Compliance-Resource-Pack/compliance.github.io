  Today in this 64x Compliance update, a lot of new things and changes have been made. One of the first things is the Nether! All the blocks have been made with care (and love). Also a lot of Overworld entities have been added, other entities are coming in future update. So take advantage of this great update, the next one is coming April 14th.
