  Hello everybody! Today we're bringing you a bit of a smaller update, but that is overshadowed by the significance of the changes and additions! On top of adding the spooky ravager, we've improved many commonly-seen textures, such as piglins, iron bars, purpur blocks or some mob effects. Additionally, we have finally fixed the incorrect scaling of the game mode switcher, a bug that was present in the pack since forever. And of course, our journey through Bedrock UI is still continuing.
