description: |
  Wow, 2020 was a wild ride, wasn't it? Let's kick off 2021 the right way, with a brand new Compliance Alpha! This time around, after the Christmas break, we're bringing you a double-size update. We've added and improved many textures, including the villager, dirt and more. (And if you've noticed a suspicious lack of previously-added 1.17 textures, you would be correct. These have been moved to a separate branch on GitHub and will be properly released once we port the pack to other versions.)
  <br><br>
  <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> As indicated by the Alpha tag, this version is very work-in-progress, and as such contains some placeholder textures. It is not the final look of the pack; many textures will have to be edited to match the general stylistic direction of the pack.
  <br><br>
  Stay tuned for future updates!
