description: |
  As fall begins and so does the school year, Compliance releases another beta, this time with a variety of small fixes and a bunch of additions to the Bedrock UI. Arctic foxes now also join their red cousins in this update and the dripstone textures have been completely redone. After going through several iterations, unlit candles have been added to the pack with lit ones likely coming in the next beta.
  <br><br>
  Bedrock users should notice smoother UI in game now, with things like the skin options page and parts of the marketplace UI now in 32x.
