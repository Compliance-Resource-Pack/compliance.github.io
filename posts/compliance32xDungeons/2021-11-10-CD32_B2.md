discontinued: true

description: |
  While the main Compliance packs have been steadily receiving updates for the past months, Compliance Dungeons has been left behind. With the Compliance project turning 1 recently, we're now changing this and bringing everybody a massive update, with all of the past 10 months of work condensed into a single release.
  <br>
  Not only have we added support for all DLCs that have come out since January, but we've also updated all textures to match the higher-quality textures of today's main Compliance pack, but we'v also added many large and small features as well. We hope you like this update, and stay tuned for future awesomeness!
  <br><br>
  TECHNICAL NOTE&#58; For all of the new features to work, this version of the pack now requires the Blueprint Loader or Custom Skins Loader. Read the changelog for more details.
  (texture authors are only credited after a texture that's completely unique to Minecraft Dungeons.)

changelog:
  Added:
    Large updates:
      - Support for Flames of the Nether DLC
      - Support for Hidden Depths DLC
      - Support for Echoing Void DLC
      - Applicable textures from Compliance (and textures that are based on them) that have been accepted to Compliance 32x since the last release
    Misc:
      - Block edge highlight shader outlines are now 1 pixel thick to match Compliance's higher resolution. This feature requires Blueprint Loader OR Custom Skins Loader (don't use both!) installed to work! If you don't install one of these mods, the edge highlight outlines will render at their normal 2px width. Huge thanks to CCCode for making this possible!
    Blocks:
      - (Soggy Swamp) Dirt (HARYA_)
      - (Soggy Swamp) Grass Side (HARYA_)
      - (Pumpkin Pastures) Large Fern Top (HARYA_)
      - (Broken Citadel) Peony Top (HARYA_)
      - (Cacti Canyon) Large Fern Top (HARYA_)
      - (Warped Forest) Allium (HARYA_)
      - (Obsidian Pinnacle) Custom 0 (DMgaming)
      - (Warped Forest) Lilac Top (HARYA_)
      - (Cacti Canyon) Azure Bluet (HARYA_)
    UI:
      - Emeralds, in instances where they previously had been using the default texture
      - Gold Currency
      - Hotbar Arrows
      - Blacksmith Anvil
      - Level Select Map Ender Pearls
      - Inventory Slot Gilded Plate
  Changed:
    - Updated all applicable textures to match the latest version of Compliance 32x
    - Updated in-game mod logo
  Fixed:
    - Square and wrong-resolution outer leaf textures in some levels (this is actually a vanilla bug but I fixed it anyway)
  Removed:
    Misc:
      - Bat (vanilla texture changed)
      - Vex (vanilla texture changed)
      - Textures based on Java Edition that have been removed from Compliance 32x since the last release
    Removed due to no longer following Compliance's texturing guidelines:
      - Arch-Illager
      - Target Dummy
      - Witch
      - Jungle Zombie
      - Zombie
      - Iron Golem Cape
  Known Issues:
    - Outer parts of oak leaves in the main menu are not transparent. I have no idea why this happens, but the leaves work properly in all other levels.
