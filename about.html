      <h1>A HISTORY OF EXPERTISE</h1>
      <p>
        We've got over a decade of experience making quality textures for Minecraft, with a rich
        history spanning from the first releases up to today.
        <br>
        <br>
        Being one of the first ever texture packs to be developed, starting all the way back in
        2010, Faithful has secured its place among the most well-known Minecraft projects.
