discontinued: true

long_text: While the main Compliance packs have been steadily receiving updates for the past months, Compliance Dungeons has been left behind. With the Compliance project turning 1 recently, we're now changing this and bringing everybody a massive update, with all of the past 10 months of work condensed into a single release.<br>Not only have we added support for all DLCs that have come out since January, but we've also updated all textures to match the higher-quality textures of today's main Compliance pack, but we'v also added many large and small features as well. We hope you like this update, and stay tuned for future awesomeness!<br><br>TECHNICAL NOTE&#58; For all of the new features to work, this version of the pack now requires the Blueprint Loader or Custom Skins Loader. Read the changelog for more details.
