long_text: "UPDATE: We've now released a hotfix that addresses some breaking issues with Iron and Diamond Horse Armour. We're taking this opportunity to also introduce other, unrelated textures that have been added to the pack since the initial post was made. The changelog below has been updated accordingly.<br><br><br>It's been some time since the last update, but we assure you that it was for good reason. Our artists have been hard at work drawing all the textures that are still missing from the pack. They've done such a great job at it that Faithful 32x for Java legacy versions is now fully complete! That's right, every single texture from every Java release version is now finished. PVP players rejoice!<br>We're also slowly inching our way to completing the Bedrock pack as well. As is tradition, the main focus of new Bedrock textures is UI, but we also have some long-awaited newcomers such as the Ender Chest in GUI and the End Portal and Gateway items.<br>Additionally, we're now supporting textures provided by the Fabric and Forge mod loaders, as well as the Fabric Mod Menu, in the main Faithful 32x pack. This release includes the first batch of these. And as always, we've also redone quite a lot old textures that needed to be brought up to modern quality standards.<br>Have fun playing with the pack!"
