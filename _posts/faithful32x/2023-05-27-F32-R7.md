  We're back again, and this time we've got a lot of new textures for you! Among other things, the new player skins introduced in 1.19.3 have now received a pretty 32x makeover. Since these were the last textures left to do for 1.19.3 and .4, this also means these versions are now fully complete and we can publish them as a full release. Additionally, several common blocks and items that were using older texture (such as diorite, melons, bottles and arrows) have now been remade to bring them up to modern quality standards. As always, many bugs have also been squashed since the last release, ensuring a smooth gaming experience for you.

  That's all from us for this update – next stop: Trails & Tales!
