  We hope you have a good holiday! In the meantime, you have just opened one of your presents that Santa Claus has slipped for you under the tree... But what do I see? Incredible, a Compliance 64x update! (I really have to stop ...)
  <br>
  So what's new in this update? Although it's not as major as the previous one, it brings many missing textures such as the drowned (even if we do not appreciate them), the horses are finally finished, the villagers and especially the most important block ... the dried kelp! You know the melody, the link is below bla bla bla.... I have nothing against you but I have something better to do! See you next year!!
