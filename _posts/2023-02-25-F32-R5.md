long_text: "How's the year for you so far? We've been keeping Faithful in the oven for a little longer this time around, and the time has finally come to take it out. Many changes have accumulated since the last release – Quality upkeep has been done on quite the amount of existing textures to ensure consistent and beautiful art, and some of the experimental 1.20 textures have been added as well. The extended font has also received a complete overhaul, fixing all sorts of errors and misinterpretations, and adding improved support for a wider range of characters in older versions. It's also now available as an OTF on <a href="https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Branding/tree/main/font">our Branding repository</a> for all your non-minecraft needs. More details below.<br>As always, we hope this update brings you an even better Minecraft experience. Please let us know if you've got any remarks."
