long_text: Hello! New update also says new content! In this update, an avalanche of textures has been added, ranging from the Overworld to the Nether. <br><br> <strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> As indicated by the Alpha tag, this version very work-in-progress, and as such contains a lot of placeholder textures. It is not the final look of the pack; many textures will have to be edited to match the general stylistic direction of the pack. <br><br> Stay tuned for future updates!
