  Hello all! Here is the (technically first) new beta for Faithful 64x! In today's update a lot of good things have been added including the kelp plant, the raw gold block, the rest of the copper blocks and the honey block! We're also introducing some new entities with the parrot, the wandering trader, the piglin brute and the husk joining in on the action! And as always, we can't forget the many changes that we've made to existing textures, for example stone, ores, grass or wool.
