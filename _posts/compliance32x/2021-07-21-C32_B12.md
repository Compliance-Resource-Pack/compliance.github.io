  Due to our Texture Guidelines recently changing, we have decided to step up our quality control and to remove all textures that no longer follow our guidelines. Please read <a href="../../compliance32x/Announcement%20Regarding%20Placeholder%20Textures">this announcement</a> if you haven't already.
  <br>
  Fortunately, this isn't everything this beta is about, as we're also presenting some new exciting texture updates! You can now burn in style with our fancy new fire textures, which, like the nether portal, have been procedurally generated based on code used in legacy Minecraft versions. Additionally, Mobile players will now finally be able to enjoy the ever-present HUD in double the resolution!
