  The big day has finally come! After seven long weeks in Alpha, <strong>Compliance 32x is finally entering its Beta stage!</strong> It was beautiful to see the pack evolve so far, and now the future is looking even brighter than before.
  <br>
  We have also finished the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Pomi108/2257f47eb42350ba39fc6ec32548448c">texture guidelines</a>, which are effective immediately, so from now on every texture submitted will have to follow them. If you've got any feedback, please say it in our Discord!
  <br>
  Due to this, the main aim of the Beta stage will be to fill in the missing textures and replace the remaining placeholders.
  <br>
  And as always, here is the changelog.
