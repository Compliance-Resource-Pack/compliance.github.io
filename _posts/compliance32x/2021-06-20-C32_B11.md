  Part 1 of Caves and Cliffs is here, and our awesome contributors have already delivered plenty of textures for it! Enjoy the all-new mobs and blocks of the update&#58; Discover the stunningly beautiful amethyst geodes and brutally slaughter masses of glow squids for glow ink sacs, only to find out that both of these features only have a single practical use. Now you can perform any of these, and much more, with the beauty of high-quality double-the-resolution textures! Oh, and also axolotls. Who doesn't love axolotls?
