  Summer's in full force, and days are getting hot again! At least where I live, and don't even get me started about Australia. But you know what's also hot? The awesome new textures our contributors have been working so hard on! In this update we're mainly re-introducing improved versions of textures removed in the previous beta, but also bringing a lot of new stuff to the table! Check it all out in detail with the changelog below&#58;
