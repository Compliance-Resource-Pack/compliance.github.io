long_text: "For as long as Faithful has existed, we've been getting requests for higher resolutions. 128x, 256x, 512x… While we would have loved to extend Faithful's repertoire, it was clear that we'd never be able to support resolutions higher than 64x.<br>That is, if we continued relying on human contributors.<br>Today, we're excited to announce a new era for Faithful. With the recent boom of AI technologies, we've been training our very own AI model to upscale textures for Faithful – and now's finally the time for it to see the light of day.<br>No longer is the tiring work of artists required to keep the pack updated and high-quality. AI does the work for us – quicker, better and at any resolution we want.<br>Thanks to this, Faithful will be merging all of its packs into a single high-resolution one, for the ultimate upscaled Minecraft experience. No more art style or resolution confusion – New Faithful is the one and only way forward."
