long_text: Some say these lands are bad, but we can assure you this beta isn't! We're almost there, we've reached 93%! This beta includes some new terracotta, edits to the gui screens, some color corrections to old textures, and a random assortment on other additions, ranging from nether bricks to bees. Enjoy!
