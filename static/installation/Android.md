Note that the exact process differs slightly depending on the Android device and version.

Find the resource pack file in your system file manager/Download folder, then open it. The pack should be installed automatically.

If this doesnâ€™t work, locate the Minecraft folder in your file manager, navigate to `games > com.mojang > resource_packs` within it and place the resource pack file there. Restart Minecraft for the changes to apply.
