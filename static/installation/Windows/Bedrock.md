Simply double-click the .mcpack file to open it. Minecraft should open and install the resource pack automatically.

If this doesn’t work, hit Windows key + R to open the Run dialog and paste `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\\resource_packs` into the text field. Press Enter to open a File Explorer window in this directory, then move your resource pack file there.

If the directory doesn’t exist, go to `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\` and create the `resource_packs` folder yourself.

Remember that it’s not possible to switch resource packs while inside a world. In case things break with loading a pack, a game restart is also recommended to clear any caches the game might keep.
