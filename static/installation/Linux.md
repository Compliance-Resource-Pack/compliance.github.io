## Vanilla Launcher
Navigate to `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks/` using your file manager. Place the resource pack .ZIP in this directory.

Your resource pack should now show up in-game. Depending on the Minecraft version you might also need to reload the resource packs menu or restart the game for the pack to appear.

*Note: For Minecraft versions 1.4 and below, the pack folder is named `texturepacks`. Most texture packs for these versions also require OptiFine/MCPatcher to be installed in order to work properly. Since these legacy versions use a different mod installation process than modern Minecraft, use of MultiMC or similar launchers is recommended.*

## MultiMC and Similar Launchers
The same as the Windows MultiMC tutorial, just with screenshots taken on Linux and with “File Explorer” swapped out for “File Manager”
