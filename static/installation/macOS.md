## Vanilla Launcher
In Finder, open the **Go** menu from the menu bar at the top. Choose **Go to Folder** from the dropdown that appears.

Paste `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks` into the text field and hit Enter. Make sure you’ve run Minecraft at least once before.

If the directory doesn’t exist, go to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/` and create the `resourcepacks` folder yourself.

Finally, drag the resource pack .ZIP file into the `resourcepacks` directory.

Your resource pack should now show up in-game. Depending on the Minecraft version you might also need to reload the resource packs menu or restart the game for the pack to appear.

*Note: For Minecraft versions 1.4 and below, the pack folder is named `texturepacks`. Most texture packs for these versions also require OptiFine/MCPatcher to be installed in order to work properly. Since these legacy versions use a different mod installation process than modern Minecraft, use of MultiMC or similar launchers is recommended.*

## MultiMC and Similar Launchers
The same as the Windows MultiMC tutorial, just with screenshots taken on macOS and with “File Explorer” swapped out for “Finder”
