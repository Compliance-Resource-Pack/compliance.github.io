Select Open in Microsoft Store and then download and install **Adv File Browser (FullTrust)**.

You're also going to need the [**Internet Browser app**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/internet-browser/9nblggh3tbjn). Download and install it, then open it. Use this browser to download your desired resource pack (for Faithful you can go to https://faithfulpack.net/downloads.) Upon clicking the download link/button, a dialog window will appear.
