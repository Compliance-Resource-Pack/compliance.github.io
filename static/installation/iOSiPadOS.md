Find the resource pack file in the Files app, then tap on it. Minecraft should open and install the pack automatically.
Unfortunately, this method is known to be very buggy on iOS. If this doesn’t work for you (which it most likely isn’t going to), you’re going to have to move the .mcpack file to the resource packs folder manually.
To do that, press and hold on the resource pack file until the context menu appears. Select the **Move** option here. A simplified file browser will be brought up. Navigate to `On my iPhone/iPad > Minecraft > games > com.mojang > resource_packs` like so:

Finally, confirm the file transfer by hitting **Move**. You will also need to restart Minecraft in order for the pack to appear.
