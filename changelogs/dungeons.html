        - Support for Hidden Depths DLC
        - Support for Echoing Void DLC
        - Applicable textures from Compliance (and textures that are based on them) that have been accepted to Compliance 32x since the last release
      - Misc:
        - Block edge highlight shader outlines are now 1 pixel thick to match Compliance's higher resolution. This feature requires Blueprint Loader OR Custom Skins Loader (don't use both!) installed to work! If you don't install one of these mods, the edge highlight outlines will render at their normal 2px width. Huge thanks to CCCode for making this possible!

    - Fixed:
      - Blocks:

      - Misc.:
        - Bat (vanilla texture changed)
        - Vex (vanilla texture changed)
        - Textures based on Java Edition that have been removed from Compliance 32x since the last release
      - Removed due to no longer following Compliance's texturing guidelines:

        - Target Dummy
        - Witch
        - Jungle Zombie
        - Zombie
        - Iron Golem Cape
    - Known Issues:
      - Blocks:
        - Outer parts of oak leaves in the main menu are not transparent. I have no idea why this happens, but the leaves work properly in all other levels.
